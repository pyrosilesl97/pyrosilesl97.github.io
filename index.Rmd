## Bio
I am a professional with experience in team management, scientific communication,
innovation and technology transfer. I am a member of the fifth generation Talentum
University and was recognized as a young leader by Shaping Horizons of the
University of Cambridge.
In 2018 I collaborated in the organization and logistics of the Second Latin American
Biotechnology Leaders Summit of Allbiotech, where I later served as Co-Coordinator
of Public Policy for that organization and attended the First Latin American
Bioeconomy Forum in San Jose, Costa Rica.
Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in plant biotechnology at CINVESTAV.
